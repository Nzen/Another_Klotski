Currently: Move a cursor around a klotski board. Eventually you can play the game, but not yet.

### intended evolution

* ~~draw board & pieces~~
* ~~draw cursor~~
* ~~move cursor with arrow keys~~
* move piece with wasd, by rules
* check win condition
* move count? smarter move count?
* solver for hints?
* win sound?

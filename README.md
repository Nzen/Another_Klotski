Currently: Solve a sliding block puzzle. _Arrow keys_ move the cursor. _Wasd_ drags the cursor & the shape beneath it, when the way is clear.

### intended evolution

* ~~draw board & pieces~~
* ~~draw cursor~~
* ~~move cursor with arrow keys~~
* ~~move piece with wasd~~
* ~~check win condition~~
* move cursor with ijkl instead
* move count? smarter move count?
* solver for hints?
* win sound?
